  <p class="lead mb-4">
    Welcome to my analysis of the Titanic competition from Kaggle. In this project, I analyzed passenger data and created several decision tree models to predict survival outcomes. Explore the insights and predictions generated from various decision tree algorithms.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    The Titanic dataset provides a wealth of information, including passenger demographics, ticket details, and more. Using this data, I have developed different decision tree models to evaluate and compare their performance in predicting whether a passenger survived or not.

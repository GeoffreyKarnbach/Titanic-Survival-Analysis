    In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of the Titanic dataset from Kaggle to develop and fine-tune different machine learning models for predicting passenger survival outcomes. The following outlines the data processing steps undertaken to enhance model accuracy and reliability.
  </p>
  <h3 class="mb-4">Data Preparation and Cleaning</h3>
  <p class="mb-4">
    The initial phase involved cleaning and preparing the dataset by addressing the following key tasks:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Attribute Selection:</strong> I excluded non-relevant attributes such as PassengerId, Ticket Number, and Cabin Number. These attributes were deemed non-contributory to the survival prediction.</li>
    <li><strong>Focus on Key Attributes:</strong> The analysis was centered around the crucial attributes: Passenger Class, Name, Sex, Age, Number of siblings/spouses, Number of parents/children, Fare, and Embarkation Port.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 class="mb-4">Handling Missing Data</h3>
  <p class="mb-4">
    Missing values were handled using a range of imputation techniques to ensure data completeness and improve model performance:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Mode Imputation:</strong> For categorical variables, missing values were filled with the most frequently occurring value (mode). This method ensures that the imputed values reflect the common category within the dataset.</li>
    <li><strong>Median Imputation:</strong> For numeric attributes, missing values were replaced with the median value. This approach minimizes the impact of outliers, providing a robust central measure for imputation.</li>
    <li><strong>K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Imputation:</strong> KNN Imputation estimates missing values based on the values of the nearest neighbors in the dataset. The algorithm identifies the K most similar records (neighbors) to the record with the missing value and uses their values to predict the missing data. This method considers the similarity between records, offering a context-sensitive approach to imputation.</li>
    <li><strong>Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE):</strong> MICE is an advanced imputation technique that models each feature with missing values as a function of other features. The process involves multiple iterations where missing values are estimated based on predictions from a regression model built on the other variables. This method accounts for the relationships between multiple variables, providing a comprehensive imputation strategy.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="mb-4">
    By employing these imputation methods, the dataset was enriched with complete and accurate information, setting the stage for robust model development and evaluation.
    After observing the performance of different imputation techniques, I selected the KNN imputation mode for the final processed dataset, used by almost all models.
  </p>
  <h3 class="mb-4">Feature Engineering</h3>
  <p class="mb-4">
    To capture more nuanced patterns in the data, I performed feature engineering, which included:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Categorization of Continuous Variables:</strong> Age and Fare were divided into meaningful categories to better reflect their impact on survival chances (e.g., Fare < 50, 50 - 100, 100 - 200, > 200).</li>
    <li><strong>New Feature Creation:</strong> Introduced new features such as <code>isAlone</code>, indicating whether a passenger was traveling alone, and <code>title</code>, extracted from passenger names to capture social and cultural information.</li>
  </ul>
